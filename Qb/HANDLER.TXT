        ErrorHANDLER is a QBasic Program Designed to help your programs cope
  with errors created by your program especially when you prompt for filenames 
  or directories and the files cant be found, also it handles Device problems, 
  printer errors,I/O errors, and program errors in fact, ErrorHANDLER is desi-
  gned to cope with any QBasic error that it can create.

        If you like ErrorHANDLER send 5.00,your address, and AOL username to

        When you send the 5.00 you will recieve ErrorHANDLER v2.0 free


                          *******Installation*******
        ErrorHANDLER *CANNOT* be run alone, it must be used as a subprogram                                 
  in your programs along with some commands at the beginning of your programs       
  to install first create a SUB called "ErrorHANDLER" then type this at 
  the beginning of your program: 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DECLARE SUB ErrorHANDLER ()
  ON ERROR GOTO HANDLER
  RESUME (wherever you want the program to continue after the error)
  (note: between ON ERROR and HANDLER: is where your program should start 
  like "CALL" or "PRINT" etc.) 
  
  HANDLER:
  CALL ErrorHANDLER
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  Then you shuld copy ErrorHANDLER into the ErrorHANDLER SUB 
  
  Whenever you run your program now it will call ErrorHANDLER instead of 
  ending your program
  (you have to do this to evry program you want it in)
