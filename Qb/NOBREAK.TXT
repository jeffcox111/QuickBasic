Welcome to QBasic NoBreak!

I have spent a *long* time researching and trying to figure out how to disable
CTRL-BREAK and CTRL-C in QBasic.  Many people have asked me throughout my
programming experiences about disabling them, but I have never been able to
say that I know how.  Until now.

I've gone step by step, inch by inch to put this all together.  I've collected
little pieces here and there to the intricate puzzle, and finally put the last
one into place.  This is it.  This is how you do it in QBasic.

Be forewarned, however, that if you intend to compile your QBasic program,
this code will add a lot of overhead.  It will not only add a considerable
amount of code size to your EXE, but it will slow it down too.  I used the
Microsoft Quick Basic 4.5 compiler to compile NoBreak.BAS into an EXEcutable
and came out with the following file sizes:

   NoBreak.EXE          requires run-time library        5,158 bytes
   NoBreak.EXE          stand-alone                     21,194 bytes

Depending on your program, the speed difference could be virtually unnoticable
(as in this case), or, if you have a large program with lots of loops and
everything, it could be substantially slower.


Now, I'll describe what all the numbers in the KEY/ON KEY commands refer to.
Use this chart.  The numbers are BASIC scan codes.  For more help than this
gives, refer to the QBasic/QuickBASIC/BASIC PDS/VBDOS/PowerBASIC help file.
