                           Space Reign   v 1.0

        Space Reign is a text-based strategy game 
      that lets you rule star systems and control 
      civilizations.  The objective is simple-- 
      TOTAL DOMINATION!!!  Your mission is to take 
      over 100 star systems successfully.  You can 
      buy a couple of items to help you on your way 
      also.  Nuclear generators take away the $500 
      cost of fuel for each ship every turn and 
      added sheilds let you win battles against alien 
      forces easily.  Of course this isn't as easy 
      as it sounds.  You'll have to put up with mining 
      strikes on planets alien invasions and of 
      course...  bankruptcy.  
      
      Good luck Commander.
